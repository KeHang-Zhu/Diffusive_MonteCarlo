# Brief intro to Classical Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)


Classical Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is a powerful computational technique used in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics to simulate the behavior of complex many-body systems. It employs a stochastic algorithm based on the transition rate between different states of the system, which enables the accurate calculation of thermodynamic properties such as energy, pressure, and chemical potential. Classical DMC is particularly useful for systems with strong quantum effects, such as molecular solids, liquids, and gases, and it can also be used to study the behavior of non-equilibrium systems. Despite its name, Classical DMC is not a fully classical method and incorporates some quantum mechanics through the use of imaginary time propagation.

Here, the codes are used for non-equilibrium spin systems and users can use the codes to study the magnetic dynamics in the external excitations.
