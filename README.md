# Diffusive_MonteCarlo

Diffusive Monte Carlo (DMC) is a powerful computational method used in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics to accurately simulate the behavior of complex quantum systems. DMC is a type of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique that employs stochastic sampling and random walks to approximate the solution to the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation. The method focuses on the ground-state energy and wave function, capturing essential quantum-mechanical effects like electron correlation and delocalization. By using a diffusion process to propagate a set of random walkers (representing quantum states), DMC can effectively excited-state components, leaving only the ground-state component. Due to its ability to treat many-body quantum systems with high accuracy and relatively low computational cost, DMC has found applications in diverse fields such as materials science, molecular systems, and nanotechnology.
